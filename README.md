# Hngstg1
This is my solution to my first hng internship task where we were ask to create an endpoint that acceps a get request and returns the response in json format hosted in the cloud.
visit "https://hngstg1.topazglam.repl.co/api/?slack_name=Olafare_Grace&track=Backend" to view the url endpoint.
